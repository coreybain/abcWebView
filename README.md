## FAQ

### How do I turn this framework into a cocoapod?

While the coding challenge in this case was meant to be limited to 1 hour, I did go over a little but wanted to try and keep it within a 2 hour timeframe. One of the cuts I decided to make was to use a framework in preference to a full on Cocoapod. This was also in part a consideration given the simplicity of the app and how as far as the app is concerned a framework acts in the same was as a Cocoapod. 
However if anyone did want to convert the framework into a Cocoapod please use this tutorial to assist you -> [Cocoapod Tutorial](https://medium.com/@shahabejaz/create-and-distribute-private-libraries-with-cocoapods-5b6507b57a03).
